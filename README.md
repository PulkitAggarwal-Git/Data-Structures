This repository contains the templates of some good and difficult data structures.

BigInt data structure was made by me as an OOPS project. You just need to make an object of this data structure.

Example:-

BigInt a = 34;
BigInt b = 57;

Key features of BigInt Data Structure:

1. It can store very large integers without any upper limit as is imposed by "int" or "long long". 

2. It is capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison
using <, >, ==, != operators.

3. It can also be used to find the length of the number.

4. It supports input and output using cin and cout.
